<table cellspacing="12" caption="Graphics">
<tr>
<td><b>Milky Way</b></td>
<td>Show the Milky Galaxy in the background</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Clouds</b></td>
<td>Display cloud layers on planets that have them (such as Earth and Venus)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Atmospheres</b></td>
<td>Enable atmospheric scattering effect; makes Earth look much more realistic</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Eclipse Shadows</b></td>
<td>Show shadows cast by planets and moons</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Other Shadows</b></td>
<td>Show shadows cast by small, irregular bodies (spacecraft, asteroids, etc.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Reflections</b></td>
<td>Show reflections on polished and metallic surfaces. This effect is visible only for a few spacecraft</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Sun Glare</b></td>
<td>Show a glare halo around the Sun when it isn't obscured</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Anaglyph Stereo</b></td>
<td>Enable this to get a stereo 3D effect when viewing with red/blue glasses</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Star Brightness</b></td>
<td>Adjusts the apparent brightness of the stars. The default setting
approximates what you'd see with your eye on a perfectly dark night. Decrease
the brightness to simulate light pollution, or increase it to show stars
as they'd appear in a long-exposure photograph.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Extra Light</b></td>
<td>Adjusts the amount of artificial light added to shadowed areas. For
realism, the extra light should be disabled by moving the slider all the
way to the left. But for ease of navigation, it may be better to add a bit
of light to the scene.
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Anti-aliasing</b></td>
<td>When enabled, anti-aliasing greatly improves visual quality by smoothing
jagged edges. Anti-aliasing may make Cosmographia run less smoothly on
slower computers. On newer, faster computers, it's best to leave
anti-aliasing enabled all the time. Cosmographia must be restarted for
changes in the anti-aliasing setting to take effect.</td>
