<p>
Movement in Cosmographia is relative to the current central object. The
central object is indicated by a rotating marker or by an arrow when it
is offscreen.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Left drag the mouse to rotate around the central object</li>
<li>Right drag to pan the view without changing position</li>
<li>Use the mouse wheel or trackpad scrolling to change the distance to the
central object</li>
<li>Double click on an object to travel close to it</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The orientation of the view can be adjusted by pressing the arrow keys. On
computers with a trackpad, you may use the rotate gesture to roll the
view about the center point.
</p>
<p>
The field of view can be adjusted in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Shift + right dragging the mouse</li>
<li>The pinch gesture on computers with trackpads</li>
</ul>
The field of view is shown at the top of the screen while it is being adjusted.
</p>
<p>
Some navigation commands are available via the menu that appears when
right clicking an object:
<ul>
<li><i>Set as center</i> makes the clicked object the new central object</li>
<li><i>Set as fixed center</i> makes the clicked object central and keeps the
view position fixed with respect to the center.
<li><i>Track</i> is used to follow the central object while keeping the
tracked object in view.</li>
</ul>
