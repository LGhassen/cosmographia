<p>
<b>Radius / Size</b><br>
The size of an object is listed in one of three ways depending on the object's
shape. For spherical objects, the radius is given. For flattened spheres
(like Saturn), two radii are given: on from center to pole, and another from
center to a point on the equator. Three dimensions are given for irregular
objects like asteroids. These are the lengths of the sides of a box just 
large enough to contain the object.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mass</b><br>
The mass of an object is listed in kilograms and, for roughly planet-sized
objects, as a fraction of Earth's mass.
</p>

<p>
<b>Density</b><br>
An object's density is generally not the same throughout. The value given is
the <i>mean density</i> given in grams per cubic centimeter. For comparison,
water has a density of about 1 gram per cubic center. A terrestrial planet
with a density of 5 or greater contains a large fraction of iron and nickel.
Densities around 3 indicate silicate rocks. And a density of about 1 may
mean that the body is composed primarily of water ice.
</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Surface gravity</b><br>
The surface gravity is only listed for approximately spherical objects; for
irregular bodies, the surface gravity may differ dramatically from point to
point. Surface gravity is listed as an acceleration and as a percentage of
Earth's gravity. On the surface of a planet with only 50% of Earth's gravity,
you would weigh half as much as on Earth.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rotation period</b><br>
The sidereal period of rotation is given; this is the time that it takes
for the planet, moon, or asteroid to complete a full rotation about an
axis through its poles. Note that rotation period is not identical to the
day length, because objects are also moving along their orbits as they are
rotating. For example, the Earth's rotation period is actually four minutes
less than its day length of 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
Many moons&#8212;including our own&#8212;are in a <i>synchronous</i> rotation
state, with each orbit taking as long as the rotation period. This results in
the same side of the moon always facing the planet it orbits.
</p>

<p>
<b>Orbital period</b><br>
For bodies orbiting the Sun, the orbital period is the length of the year. In
general, it's the amount of time it takes for a body to complete one orbit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perihelion / Perigee / Periapsis</b><br>
Perihelion is the point in an object's orbit when it is closest to the Sun.
Perigee is the equivalent term for Earth-orbiting objects, and periapsis
is the generic word, appropriate for any central body. The
listed value is the distance to the central body at periapsis. This distance
is given in kilometers and astronomical units, or AU. An astronomical unit
is defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth.
</p>

<p>
<b>Aphelion / Apogee / Apoapsis</b><br>
As perihelion et al, except referring to the point at which an object
is <i>farthest</i> from whatever body it orbits. An object in a perfectly
circular orbit will have an apoapsis distance equivalent to its periapsis
distance.
</p>

<p><b>Eccentricity</b><br>
The eccentricity of an orbit describes its shape. A perfectly circular orbit
has an eccentricity of zero. Elliptical orbits have eccentricities between
zero and one. The closer the eccentricity of an ellipse is to one, the more
stretched it is compared to a circle. The planets in our Solar System
have low eccentricity, roughly circular orbits. In contrast, comets often
have highly elongated orbits with eccentricities near one.
