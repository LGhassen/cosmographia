<h1>Data Sources</h1>
<p>
To realistically depict the Solar System, Cosmographia must integrate
astronomical data from many different sources.
</p>

<p>
<b>Planet maps</b><br>
These are nearly always mosaics of images acquired by
spacecraft missions. No synthetic surface maps have been used; unmapped
areas are shown in a uniform color, chosen to match the average color of
the surface while still indicating that no data is available. The full list
of texture sources is available <a href="file:./textures/README.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Shape models</b></br>
3D models for non-spherical moons and asteroids. The geometry is
derived from real sources where available. Where no shape model exists for
a body, a model of a similarly sized body may be substituted. These
substitutions are noted in the description text.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ephemeris data</b></br>
Orbital ephemerides for planets and moons and trajectories for spacecraft.
JPL's DE406 ephemeris is used for the positions of the planets, Pluto and the
Moon. Semi-analytic theories are employed to compute the positions of the
major natural satellites of the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Mars. To reproduce
some of the Cassini encounters with moons of Saturn, it has been necessary to
supplement these theories with tables of Chebyshev polynomials covering the
time period of the mission.
</p>

<p>
<b>Star catalog</b><br>
Cosmographia is using the all stars from the Tycho-2 catalog
that are visually brighter than magnitude 10, or approximately 950,000 stars.
The Milky Way map was generated from the NOMAD star catalog by summing the
contributions of about half a billion stars of magnitude 11 or less.
