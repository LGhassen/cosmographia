<h1>Cosmographia model sources</h1>

<p>
The Dawn and Rosetta spacecraft models were created by Brian Jones and
are used in Cosmographia by his permission.
</p>

<p>
The model of Deimos is from Peter Thomas of Cornell University.
<p>

<p>
The models of Proteus, Amalthea and Hyperion are by Phil Stooke.
<a href="http://publish.uwo.ca/~pjstooke/plancart.htm">His web page</a> has
a list of links to resources for mapping small Solar System bodies.
</p>

<p>
Shape models of the asteroids below are from <a href="http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/web.php">DAMIT</a> (Database of Asteroid Models from
Inversion Techniques). Some of the models have been remeshed to reduce
rendering artifacts.<br>
<ul>
<li>2 Pallas</li>
<li>3 Juno</li>
<li>5 Astraea</li>
<li>8 Flora</li>
<li>10 Hygiea</li>
<li>21 Lutetia</li>
<li>511 Davida</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The models of Itokawa, Eros, Phoebe, Phobos, and Vesta were derived from
spacecraft images by Robert Gaskell. The source images were acquired by
Hayabusa (Itokawa), NEAR Shoemaker (Eros), Cassini (Phoebe), the Viking 1
orbiter (Phobos), and Dawn (Vesta). The models were converted from a SPICE
shape kernel (Vesta) or implicitly connected quadrilateral files (the rest.)
They have been processed to convert some geometric detail to a normal map.

<p>
The model of asteroid 243 Ida was created by Peter Thomas from Galileo images
acquired during its 28 Aug 1993 encounter with the asteroid. The mosaic map
was assembled by Phil Stooke. The original map can be found <a href="http://sbn.psi.edu/pds/asteroid/EAR_A_3_RDR_STOOKEMAPS_V1_0/maps/">here</a>.
