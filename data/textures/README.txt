improved a map originally created by Emily Lakdawalla and Calvin Hamilton)

earth-clouds.dds - Earth cloud map from NASA's Blue Marble data set:
http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2432
The image was converted from TIFF to a DXT5 compressed texture, but it is
otherwise unchanged from the original.

The Mars map is derived from the Viking merged color mosaic, available here:
http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/mdim_color/  The original was globally
desaturated and color adjusted to produce the compressed texture map mars.dds.

The Saturn and Uranus ring textures are from Celestia 1.6.0. The Saturn ring
texture was created by Grant Hutchison from Cassini images and opacities
derived from stellar transit measurements:

The Io and Europa maps are from Steve Albers and NOAA's "Science on a Sphere"
project. The web page http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html has all of
his maps and a complete list of original data sources.

The Ganymede and Callisto maps are by Bjorn Jonsson. All of his planetary maps
can be found at http://www.mmedia.is/~bjj/planetary_maps.html

The maps of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus are
from CICLOPS (Cassini Imaging Central Library for OPerations):

== Uranian satellite maps ==

All of the maps of the moons of Uranus are based on Voyager 2 images.  Only
half of each moon was illuminated during the flyby, thus there are large
blank areas in each map. The maps are modified from the originals by
filling in the black regions with a midtone constant color. No attempt has
been made to add artificial details.

The map of Miranda is from JPL: http://maps.jpl.nasa.gov/uranus.html

The map of Ariel is from Ted Stryk. Some of the regions in this map are only
visible because they were illuminated by Uranus-shine during the Voyager 2
encounter. This abstract describes the reprocessing of the Voyager images:

The map of Umbriel is from Phil Stooke. The original is here:

The maps of Titania and Oberon are from Ted Stryk and Steve Albers.

The map of Pluto is derived from a map created by Marc Buie from Hubble
Space Telescope images. The black area of the map was filled in with a
flat color, but it is otherwise unmodified from Buie's original:
