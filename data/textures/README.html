<h1>Cosmographia map sources</h1>

<p>milkyway.jpg - The original all-sky panorama is from ESO/S. Brunier. It
was modified by Guillermo Abramson, primarily to remove stars and adjust
saturation. The original map may be found 
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0932a/">here</a>.

mercury.dds - Mosaic of images from MESSENGER. Credit: NASA/Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Black areas near north pole of original were filled in with a flat gray.
The gray scale map was tinted with a solid color that is a better match
to Mercury's overall surface color than a neutral gray.

venus.dds - Mosaic of Magellan radar mapping swaths from Steve Albers (who
improved a map originally created by Emily Lakdawalla and Calvin Hamilton)

venus-clouds.jpg, saturn.jpg, Callisto and Ganymede maps - Created by Bj&#246;rn J&#243;nsson and available from
<a href="http://www.mmedia.is/~bjj/planetary_maps.html">his planetary maps site</a>.
</p>

<p>
earth-clouds.dds - Earth cloud map from 
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2432">NASA's Blue Marble data set</a>.
The image was converted from TIFF to a DXT5 compressed texture, but it is
otherwise unchanged from the original.
</p>

<p>
The Mars map is derived from the Viking merged color mosaic, available here:
http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/mdim_color/  The original was globally
desaturated and color adjusted to produce the compressed texture map mars.dds.
</p>

<p>
The map of Phobos is a mosaic of Mars Express images assembled by DLR / ESA. It
was modified by Chris Laurel to remove the sharp seam at 0 degree meridian.
</p>

<p>
The Deimos map was created by Phil Stooke and is used unmodified except for
compression and a 180 degree shift.
</p>

<p>
jupiter.dds - Created by Steve Albers for the Science on a
Sphere project.
</p>

<p>
The Saturn and Uranus ring textures are from Celestia 1.6.0. The Saturn ring
texture was created by Grant Hutchison from Cassini images and opacities
derived from stellar transit measurements described
<a href="http://pds-rings.arc.nasa.gov/ringocc/ringocc.html">here</a>.

neptune.jpg, uranus.jpg - Created by James Hastings-Trew. Hosted
at his <a href="http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html">Planet
Pixel Emporium</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Io and Europa maps are from Steve Albers and NOAA's "Science on a Sphere"
project. <a href="http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html">This page</a> has
all of his maps and a complete list of original data sources.
</p>

<p>
The maps of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus are
from <a href="http://www.ciclops.org/maps.php">CICLOPS (Cassini Imaging Central Library for OPerations)</a>
</p>

<p>
All of the maps of the moons of Uranus are based on Voyager 2 images.  Only
half of each moon was illuminated during the flyby, thus there are large
blank areas in each map. The maps are modified from the originals by
filling in the black regions with a midtone constant color. No synthetic
details have been added.
</p>

<p>
The map of Miranda is from JPL's <a href="http://maps.jpl.nasa.gov/uranus.html">Uranus page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The map of Ariel is from Ted Stryk. Some of the regions in this map are only
visible because they were illuminated by Uranus-shine during the Voyager 2
encounter. This abstract describes the reprocessing of the Voyager images:

<p>
The map of Umbriel is from Phil Stooke. The original was posted on
<a href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=4701">unmannedspaceflight.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
The maps of Titania and Oberon are from Ted Stryk and Steve Albers.
</p>

<p>
The map of Pluto is derived from a map created by Marc Buie from Hubble
Space Telescope images. The black area of the map was filled in with a
flat color, but it is otherwise unmodified from
<a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/pluto/hrcmap.html">Buie's original</a>. The map of Charon is also from Marc Buie. The paper containing the map
may be downloaded <a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~layoung/eprint/Buie09_PlutoCharonMap_submit.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The map of Ceres is derived from one presented in "Photometric analysis
of 1 Ceres and surface mapping from HST observations" by Li et al (2006).
The original false color map was converted to gray scale and tinted with
a color derived from SMASS data. Some additional blurring was required to
remove a visible seam at zero degrees longitude. The original map exaggerated
albedo differences and so constrast reduction was applied to make the map
more visually realistic.
