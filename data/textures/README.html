neptune.jpg, uranus.jpg - Created by James Hastings-Trew. Hosted

Pixel Emporium</a>.
</p>

<p>
mercury.jpg, jupiter.dds - Created by Steve Albers for the Science on a
Sphere project.
</p>

<p>
venus.dds - Mosaic of Magellan radar mapping swaths from Steve Albers (who
improved a map originally created by Emily Lakdawalla and Calvin Hamilton)
</p>

<p>
venus-clouds.jpg, saturn.jpg, Callisto and Ganymede maps - Created by Bj&#246;rn J&#243;nsson and available from
<a href="http://www.mmedia.is/~bjj/planetary_maps.html">his planetary maps site</a>.
</p>

<p>
earth-clouds.dds - Earth cloud map from 
<a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=2432">NASA's Blue Marble data set</a>.
The image was converted from TIFF to a DXT5 compressed texture, but it is
otherwise unchanged from the original.
</p>

<p>
The Mars map is derived from the Viking merged color mosaic, available here:
http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/mdim_color/  The original was globally
desaturated and color adjusted to produce the compressed texture map mars.dds.
</p>

<p>
The map of Phobos is a mosaic of Mars Express images assembled by DLR / ESA. It
was modified by Chris Laurel to remove the sharp seam at 0 degree meridian.
</p>

<p>
The Deimos map was created by Phil Stooke and is used unmodified except for
compression and a 180 degree shift.
</p>

<p>
The Saturn and Uranus ring textures are from Celestia 1.6.0. The Saturn ring
texture was created by Grant Hutchison from Cassini images and opacities
derived from stellar transit measurements described
<a href="http://pds-rings.arc.nasa.gov/ringocc/ringocc.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Io and Europa maps are from Steve Albers and NOAA's "Science on a Sphere"
project. <a href="http://laps.noaa.gov/albers/sos/sos.html">This page</a> has
all of his maps and a complete list of original data sources.
</p>

<p>
The maps of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus are
from <a href="http://www.ciclops.org/maps.php">CICLOPS (Cassini Imaging Central Library for OPerations)</a>
</p>

<p>
All of the maps of the moons of Uranus are based on Voyager 2 images.  Only
half of each moon was illuminated during the flyby, thus there are large
blank areas in each map. The maps are modified from the originals by
filling in the black regions with a midtone constant color. No synthetic
details have been added.
</p>

<p>
The map of Miranda is from JPL's <a href="http://maps.jpl.nasa.gov/uranus.html">Uranus page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The map of Ariel is from Ted Stryk. Some of the regions in this map are only
visible because they were illuminated by Uranus-shine during the Voyager 2
encounter. This abstract describes the reprocessing of the Voyager images:

<p>
The map of Umbriel is from Phil Stooke. The original was posted on
<a href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=4701">unmannedspaceflight.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
The maps of Titania and Oberon are from Ted Stryk and Steve Albers.
</p>

<p>
The map of Pluto is derived from a map created by Marc Buie from Hubble
Space Telescope images. The black area of the map was filled in with a
flat color, but it is otherwise unmodified from
<a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/pluto/hrcmap.html">Buie's original</a>
</p>

<p>
The map of Vesta was created by Phil Stooke based on early images from
Dawn. It is a preliminary map that shows the major features on Vesta, but since
it hasn't been fitted to a shape model of Vesta, the locations of
these features is not exact. See the <a href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?s=&showtopic=7011&view=findpost&p=175990">Dawn thread at
unmannedspaceflight.com</a> for further information. The map has been modified
slightly from the original by replacing changing the color of unmapped regions
from black to gray.
