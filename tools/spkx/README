spkx is a tool extract Chebyshev polynomial coefficients from a SPICE SPK file.
It handles SPK type 2 (Chebyshev polynomials for position) and type 3
(Chebyshev polynomials for position and velocity) data. spkx was written to
generate files for Cosmographia, which always calculates velocities as the
derivatives of the position polynomials; thus, the coefficients for the
velocity polynomials are not written out. Eliminating the velocity coefficients
reduces the amount of data required by 50% for satellite ephemerides, which
are nearly all stored as type 3 data.

The command line is:

spkx <input spk> <output file> <start date> <end date> <body name>

A typical usage is:

spkx sat317.bsp out.cheb "1900-Jan-02 TDB" "2050-Jan-01 TDB" "phoebe"

The start and end dates must be valid SPICE date strings. Body name is
the NAIF name of an object in the input SPK file (and is case insensitive).


The binary output file has the following format:

 * 8 bytes - header "CHEBPOLY"
 * 4 bytes - int32 - record count
 * 4 bytes - int32 - polynomial degree
 * 8 bytes - double - start time (seconds since J2000.0 TDB)
 * 8 bytes - double - interval covered by each polynomial (in seconds)
 * data - 3 * sizeof(double) * (degree + 1) * record count bytes
 
Polynomial coefficients for each interval are stored as:
   x0 x1 x2 ... xn y0 y1 y2 ... yn z0 z1 z2 ... zn

Byte order is little endian (Intel x86). Actually, the current version of
spkx does not swap byte order on big-endian systems, so it will only generate
correct output files when compiled on little-endian machines.
