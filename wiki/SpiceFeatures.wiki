#summary Support for SPICE within Cosmographia

= Introduction =

Support for JPL's SPICE system in Cosmographia is currently in development

= Building =

At the current time, SPICE support is disabled in the default build. It can be turned on by uncommenting one line in the project file (cosmographia.pro):

{{{
CONFIG += spice
}}}

= SPICE Trajectories =

A Cosmographia trajectory may be linked to the position of a SPICE object.

{{{
"trajectory" :
{
    "type" : "Spice",
    "target" : "Ymir",
    "center" : "Saturn",
    "frame" : "ECLIPJ2000"
}
}}}

  * The target and center properties may be a recognized SPICE name or a NAIF integer code
  * The frame is a string giving the name of either a built-in inertial frame, or a frame defined in a SPICE frame kernel
  * If the frame is omitted, it defaults to EME J2000

= SPICE Rotation Model = 

A Cosmographia rotation model may be linked to a named SPICE frame.
